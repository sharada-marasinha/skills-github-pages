# 👋 Welcome to My Blog!

Hi there! I’m **Sharadha Marasinha**, a full-stack developer from Sri Lanka 🇱🇰.  
This is the start of my personal blog where I’ll be sharing my journey in coding, open source, and career growth.

## 🔧 What I’ll Share

- 💻 Tutorials on **Spring Boot**, **JavaFX**, **Angular**, and more
- 🌐 My experience building real-world apps (like [Exam-Q](https://github.com/sharada-marasinha/Exam-Q))
- 🧠 Tips on GitHub, project workflows, and contributing to open source
- 🧪 Experiments with AI, automation, and new tools like GitHub Copilot

## 🎯 My Goal

To help other students and junior developers **learn by doing** — through clear examples, free tools, and real code.
